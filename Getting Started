For this project, we need to make a few assumptions about the methods used for extracting the metrics from the consumer-grade monitors you employ. 
1. You utilize FitaBase for compiling and downloading your monitor data
2. Your data is downloaded as a csv or XLSX format
and 
3. You already have permission from the monitor company to download, analyze, and report on your findings

Let's start with the Excel document titled "Consumer-monitors practice.1". Utilize either VBA to slice the data into just the rows and columns that are of interest
In other words, we want to remove all rows and columns that do not contain the headers and the data associated with those headers.
